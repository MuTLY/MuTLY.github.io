    <center><strong>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND FEES</strong></center>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Managed Advice</em> Services</strong>
    Your plan sponsor has appointed Transamerica Retirement Advisors, LLC ("Investment Manager") as an investment manager to your retirement plan ("Plan") for the <em>Managed Advice</em> service ("<em>Managed Advice</em>"). As described in more detail in this Agreement, the Investment Manager, a registered investment advisor, provides the underlying investment advice and portfolio construction with respect to <em>Managed Advice</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Upon your effective date, you are subscribed to <em>Managed Advice</em>, a managed account asset allocation service comprised of asset allocation portfolios using eligible investment options, as determined by the Investment Manager, available in your Plan. Upon enrollment in <em>Managed Advice</em>, you will receive an investment portfolio allocated among all or a portion of your Plan's investment options that is based upon your retirement time frame, retirement account balance, and overall financial status. When constructing your investment portfolio the <em>Managed Advice</em> service will take into consideration any other investments you hold inside your Plan account that are not included in your <em>Managed Advice</em> portfolio and also any assets held outside your plan account if you elect to provide this information. Your investment portfolio provided by the <em>Managed Advice</em> service will be the product of a computer program applying portfolio management methodologies developed, maintained and overseen by an Independent Financial Expert retained by the Investment Manager. The Independent Financial Expert has constructed and maintains a series of model asset allocation portfolios to form the basis for the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. The Independent Financial Expert also designed and maintains computer software and systems that establish your personalized investment portfolio using the model portfolio appropriate for you based on your personal information and applying the model portfolio using your Plan's investment options. The Independent Financial Expert's model asset allocation portfolios and computer software and systems are based on generally accepted principles of modern investment theory. The Independent Financial Expert is not owned or controlled by the Investment Manager. The Independent Financial Expert has sole control over the development and maintenance of its model asset allocation portfolios, the computer software and systems used to provide your investment portfolio, and the portfolio management methodologies used to construct and maintain its model asset allocation portfolios and its software and systems. The Investment Manager may not change the Independent Financial Expert's model portfolios or its software or systems or modify the personalized investment portfolio established for you using the software and systems developed and maintained by the Independent Financial Expert for the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. <strong>You give the <em>Managed Advice</em> service discretionary authority to allocate your Plan account assets and contributions among the investment alternatives available in your Plan, which means that you authorize the <em>Managed Advice</em> service to give account directions to Transamerica Retirement Solutions, LLC, your Plan's provider of recordkeeping services ("Transamerica"), or the Plan's trustee for your Plan account without your approval of each transaction.  You understand and agree that the <em>Managed Advice</em> asset allocation portfolios will change over time, including the investment options used within such portfolios, as deemed appropriate by the Independent Financial Expert.  You further understand and agree that your account will have automated rebalancing transactions that will take place over time within your account as you approach your selected retirement year, as well as beyond that year.</strong> Your balances in any of the investment options offered by your Plan may be liquidated or rebalanced upon your enrollment in the service, provided that certain Plan accounts or investments may be subject to restrictions. Your entire account balance will be rebalanced according to your <em>Managed Advice</em> asset allocation unless a restriction is in place for a portion of your account that makes it unavailable for rebalancing. Such assets will be excluded from the automated rebalancing transactions until such time as the restriction is removed. Rebalancing may not occur for <em>de minimis</em> total account balances.
</p>
<p>
    The Investment Manager has retained Morningstar Investment Management, LLC ("Morningstar") to act as "Independent Financial Expert" for the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. Morningstar is registered as an investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Investment Manager pays Morningstar a fee for developing and providing the model asset allocation portfolios and software and systems used in connection with the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. However, Morningstar's fee does not depend upon and is not affected in any way by the personalized investment portfolio provided to you in connection with the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. As part of the <em>Managed Advice</em> service, you will also have access to one-on-one advisory services provided by a representative of the Investment Manager. These services are described below under the heading "<em>One-on-One Advisory Services.</em>"
</p>
<p>
    In selecting the <em>Managed Advice</em> service, you should consider your other assets, income, and investments (equity in a home, IRA investments, savings accounts, and interests in other qualified and non-qualified plans) in addition to your assets in the Plan. You should review your financial situation at least once a year and reconsider participation in the <em>Managed Advice</em> service if your circumstances change. As discussed below, while the Investment Manager will contact you in an attempt to obtain updated information about your account, you agree that it is your responsibility to notify the Investment Manager promptly of any change that may affect the manner in which your account should be allocated, and you can update your information any time by accessing your online account.
</p>
<p>
    Asset allocation portfolios provided within the <em>Managed Advice</em> service may include mutual funds, collective trusts, or other investment vehicles available under your Plan, some or all of which may be managed by the Investment Manager or by affiliates of the Investment Manager and Transamerica, or with respect to which the Investment Manager, Transamerica or one of their affiliates receives administrative or shareholder servicing fees.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Managed Advice</em> asset allocation portfolios do not include employer stock, individual securities, target date funds, or other investment options deemed inappropriate for use within the portfolios. The Independent Financial Expert may through its screening process or other requirements determine that certain investment options should be excluded from the asset allocation portfolios. Accordingly, you may not be able to invest in such options unless you unsubscribe from the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. Conversely, certain investment options may only be offered through the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. Accordingly, if you choose to unsubscribe from <em>Managed Advice</em>, you will no longer be invested in such investment options. You will be required to choose other available investment options from your Plan's line up.
</p>
<p>
    You will likely not have the ability to maintain balances in any other investment options when participating in the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. However, some employers may choose to allow participants to maintain certain options that already have existing balances, but such options will be "walled off" from any investment activity while enrolled in <em>Managed Advice</em>. Once enrolled in the <em>Managed Advice</em> service, you will no longer be able to make investment allocation changes within the investment options in your account, including functionality for fund-to-fund transfers or changing investment option allocations. You will also no longer be able to transfer assets from an employer-stock option or a self-directed brokerage account to another investment option. Once enrolled you retain full access to inquire about your account, to sell employer stock (at which point the cash generated from such sale will become subject to the <em>Managed Advice</em> service), to make transactions within your self-directed brokerage account, and to access retirement-related services such as requesting loans or taking a distribution. You may regain the ability to make transactions among investment options the next business day after you cancel your participation in the <em>Managed Advice</em> service.
</p>
<p>
    The Investment Manager is not responsible for voting proxies for securities in your Plan account or for acting on any litigation, corporate action, bankruptcy, or any similar legal or administrative proceeding relating to any investments in your Plan account.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>One-on-One Advisory Services</em></strong>
    As discussed above, the Investment Manager will also make available one-on-one advisory services to you, as a participant in the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. Upon your request, the Investment Manager's Investment Advisor Representatives ("IARs") can review with you, either by phone or in-person (depending on the option your employer has chosen), your current financial situation, retirement needs and goals. IARs can help you answer questions, such as, how much to save, when to retire, how your account is invested, within the <em>Managed Advice</em> service, and how your strategy will evolve over time and additional information based on outputs from the Independent Financial Expert's engine. An IAR can also help you sign up for the <em>Managed Advice</em> service, and help you execute contribution updates. IARs may also provide assistance by explaining the fundamentals of asset allocation, having an appropriate mix of equity and fixed income investments, and the investments that are available to you. While the IAR can help assist with these overall retirement readiness assessments, neither the IAR nor the Investment Manager provide investment advisory services for your non-Plan accounts or restricted investments.
</p>
<p>
    At your request, an IAR will discuss with you, at least annually, your investment objectives and goals with respect to <em>Managed Advice</em>. You agree that it is your responsibility to provide the Investment Manager with updated information, as necessary, and that the Investment Manager, its IARs and all other persons affiliated with Investment Manager have the right to rely on such information. An IAR will be available to you on an ongoing basis to assist with additional questions on <em>Managed Advice</em> and to ascertain any changes in your financial circumstances and/or investment objectives relevant to <em>Managed Advice</em>. If you do not contact the Investment Manager on an at least annual basis, the Investment Manager will contact you, in a manner deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager, requesting you to update your account with any relevant changes to your financial situation and to provide you the opportunity to make reasonable restrictions on the mutual funds, collective trusts, and other investment vehicles available under your Plan used to construct your asset allocation portfolio.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that you may not be assigned the same IAR each time you receive one-on-one advisory services and that IARs work together as a team to provide one-on-one advisory services to you.
</p>
<p>
    You agree and understand that one-on-one advisory services are provided to you on a periodic basis, meaning it is provided to you based on your needs at a particular point in time. Accordingly, the Investment Manager does not continuously review or update any one-on-one advice, guidance or reports provided unless you contact the Investment Manager and provide or request additional information. You also understand that while the <em>Managed Advice</em> service has discretionary authority to allocate your Plan account assets and contributions among the investment alternatives available in your Plan via the asset allocation portfolios, the recommendations regarding retirement Plan contribution rates are non-discretionary, meaning you must affirmatively act or provide us with your permission to implement an IAR's contribution rate recommendation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You agree and understand that neither the Investment Manager, the Independent Financial Expert, nor any IAR guarantees the performance of any recommendations that are provided in connection with the <em>Managed Advice</em> service or associated one-on-one advisory services.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Investment Manager and its IARs do not provide, and <em>Managed Advice</em>, including the one-on-one advisory services, does not include, legal, tax, or accounting advice. Before making decisions with legal, tax, or accounting ramifications, you should consult appropriate professionals for advice that is specific to your situation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Managed Advice</em> Fees and Other Expenses</strong>
    Your Plan sponsor has authorized the deduction of a participant fee at an effective annual rate of tagFEEtag% based upon the average daily net asset value of your account assets allocated to the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. This fee covers any applicable investment management fees to the Investment Manager (a portion of which may be used to pay the Independent Financial Expert), investment education and support services related to <em>Managed Advice</em>, as well as costs of administering the service. This fee is accrued daily and is debited from your account balance on a monthly basis. If you cancel your participation in the <em>Managed Advice</em> service or if your retirement Plan terminates its services agreement with Transamerica, the outstanding fee at the time of cancellation will be debited from your account balance on the date of cancellation. The fees are subject to change, as agreed with your retirement Plan's sponsor, provided that you will be notified prior to the institution of any such change.
</p>
<p>
    You will also bear the expenses of the underlying investment options in which your Plan account is invested. Fund prospectuses or similar disclosure documents contain additional information on such fees and expenses. Certain investment options in your retirement Plan may charge a redemption fee. Redemption fees vary in amount and application from investment option to investment option. It is possible that transactions initiated under the <em>Managed Advice</em> service may result in the imposition of a redemption fee on one or more investment options available in your Plan. Any redemption fees will be deducted from your account balance.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Communications</em></strong>
    You will receive confirmations of all transactions in your account attributable to the <em>Managed Advice</em> service and the other information with respect to activity in your account that you would receive if you were not enrolled in the <em>Managed Advice</em> service. Any communications to you under this Agreement will be provided to your mailing address or your email address on record with Transamerica. You agree to notify Transamerica promptly if your mailing address and/or email address changes. You agree to receive required compliance communications from the Investment Manager at your email address on file with Transamerica (including, without limitation, our annual privacy notice, written disclosure statement, and any amendments to this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may call Transamerica at any time to receive a paper copy of any such document at no charge to you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>Termination of Service</em>
        You may cancel participation in the <em>Managed Advice</em> service at any time without penalty.  You may terminate your participation by unsubscribing from the service online at my.trsretire.com, or by calling tagTERMINATION_PHONE_NUMBERtag.  This Agreement will also automatically terminate upon termination of your Plan sponsor's agreement with Transamerica and/or the Investment Manager.  When your participation in the <em>Managed Advice</em> service is cancelled, your Plan account assets will remain in the investment options and allocations held in your Plan account as of the date of the cancellation until you or the Plan's sponsor takes further action.

<p>
    <center><strong>Please Read This Following Clause Carefully—It May Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court</center></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Agreement to Binding Arbitration</em></strong>
    All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable (except for the class action waiver below). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable in court. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator's award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim and will include a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of this Agreement) with respect to any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement. Either party may request a panel of three (3) arbitrators in lieu of only one (1) arbitrator. The parties will make reasonable efforts to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator chosen from the JAMS panel and the arbitrator(s) must be neutral. The arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. However, you have the right to have the arbitration hearing(s) take place at a JAMS location closest to where you reside. The interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The parties agree that all proceedings before the arbitrators will remain confidential between the parties. The requirement of confidentiality, however, either party may register the judgment on any arbitral award in an appropriate court, and the parties may disclose information regarding the arbitration if required by law or judicial decision. This agreement to binding arbitration in no way limits or affects the parties' rights under the Investment Advisers Act. The parties further agree that nothing in this agreement precludes any party from filing or participating in administrative proceedings before government administrative agencies to address alleged violations of law enforced by those state agencies.
</p>
<p>
    JAMS' RULES GOVERNING THE ARBITRATION MAY BE ACCESSED AT WWW.JAMSADR.COM OR BY CALLING JAMS AT 800.352.5267. IF YOU INITIATE AN ARBITRATION AGAINST TRANSAMERICA, $250 IS THE ONLY ARBITRATION FEE YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY EQUIVALENT TO CURRENT COURT FILING FEES. ALL OTHER JAMS ARBITRATION COSTS WILL BE BORNE BY TRANSAMERICA, INCLUDING ANY REMAINING JAMS CASE MANAGEMENT FEE AND ALL PROFESSIONAL FEES FOR THE ARBITRATOR'S SERVICES. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION. THE PARTIES ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT ALTHOUGH ARBITRATION ALLOWS FOR THE DISCOVERY OR EXCHANGE OF NON-PRIVILEGED INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE DISPUTE, THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver</em></strong>
    he parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding ("Class Action"), and the parties expressly waive their right to file a Class Action in any forum. The arbitrator(s) is empowered to award full relief to an individual claimant, but any relief awarded cannot extend beyond that individual claimant. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any court or arbitrator(s) determines that the Class Action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason (including any alleged incompatibility with the Investment Advisors Act or other federal securities laws or regulations), or that an arbitration can proceed as a Class Action, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS AGREEMENT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THEIR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, THEY UNDERSTAND AND CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY, THROUGH ARBITRATION.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Exception - Small Claims Court Claims</em></strong>
    Notwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
