        &lt;h3 class=&quot;panel-title&quot;&gt;Target Date Funds - An all-in-one savings solution.&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;panel-body&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's easy to see why. With target date funds, you have the option of picking one fund with the target date that is closest to the date you want to retire. The funds diversify across a broad mix of domestic and international stocks, and fixed income investments like bonds. The fund gradually adjusts its investment strategy from more aggressive to more conservative as the fund's target date approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each fund &quot;targets&quot; a specific year, so you can consider choosing the one closest to when you expect to retire or begin withdrawing assets. Simple as they seem, target date funds aren't foolproof. They're subject to the same risks as the assets they hold. In general, the larger the stake in stocks, the greater the risk. That may not be a big problem if your target is decades away - hopefully you'll have time to recoup losses and take advantage of any market upswings between now and then. But if you expect to retire in just a few years, an ill-timed, across-the-board market crash could put a crimp in your plans.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;no-vertical-margin&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the facts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A fund's target date really represents an allocation. That's the mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments the fund aims to hold by its target year, based on its &quot;glide path&quot; or the schedule of assets shifts it makes over time. The date doesn't mean your account will never lose money, or that your account will be fully funded by then. Indeed, growing a viable nest egg depends mostly on three factors: how much you save, how much income you'll need in retirement and how you allocate your investments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;margin-bottom-lg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;disclosure&quot;&gt;Asset allocation and diversification do not assure or guarantee better performance, cannot eliminate the risk of investment losses, and do not protect against an overall declining market. Retirement date portfolios are subject to the same risks as the underlying asset classes in which they invest. The higher the portfolio's allocation is to stocks, the greater the risk. The principle value of the portfolio is not guaranteed at any time, including at and after the target date.&lt;/p&gt;
