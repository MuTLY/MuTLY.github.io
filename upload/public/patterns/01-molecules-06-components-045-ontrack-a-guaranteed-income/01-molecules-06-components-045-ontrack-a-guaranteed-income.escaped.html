&lt;p class=&quot;disclosure&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;SecurePath for Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; consists of a group variable annuity contract which offers certain guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits to participants. Although &lt;em&gt;SecurePath for Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; provides a guaranteed income base as well as a guaranteed income amount consisting of a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit, the investment options available under the product are variable investments and may lose value. Certain withdrawals will reduce a participant's income base, and therefore the guaranteed income amount. A plan sponsor may exercise certain rights under the group variable annuity contract that may terminate the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits available to participants, including termination of the contract, termination of the plan, or the transfer of the assets left under the contract to another investment fund. Guarantees are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the contract and the prospectus.&lt;/p&gt;
