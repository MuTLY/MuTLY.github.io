    &lt;div class=&quot;panel-body&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Why is diversification important? By choosing a mix of different investments you can help manage your risks and increase your exposure to market opportunities. Custom Model Portfolios offer diversification in one easy step.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Based on your risk tolerance, you can simply pick one portfolio made up of investments already in your plan's fund lineup. Your current and future balances will be invested according to the porfolio's allocations. There Model Portfolios are broadly diversified investment portfolios composed of the individual investment options in your plan. Each Model Portfolio is tailored to a specific investment goal and risk profile and will be professionally managed to help you stay on track with your investment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While Custom Model Portfolios make investing easy, you should still review the funds that make up the portfolios and consider how well each fund's investment objective matches your savings goals, investment horizon and the risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;disclosure&quot;&gt;If you are considering a custom portfolio, first think about your personal circumstances, market outlook, risk tolerance, and the potential universe of appropriate investments. If you subscribe to the service, your account will be rebalanced to the portfolio option you select. From time to time, funds may be added to or removed from the custom portfolio mixes, or changes may occur to the portfolios' target investment allocations. The custom model portfolios are subject to the same risks as the underlying assets in which they invest. The higher the portfolio's allocation to stocks, the greater the risk. The portfolio's principal value is never guaranteed. Transamerica Retirement Solutions does not provide advice to your account. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against market loss.&lt;/p&gt;
