                <p>Why is diversification important? By choosing a mix of different investments you can help manage your risks and increase your exposure to market opportunities. Custom Model Portfolios offer diversification in one easy step.</p>
                <p>Based on your risk tolerance, you can simply pick one portfolio made up of investments already in your plan's fund lineup. Your current and future balances will be invested according to the porfolio's allocations. There Model Portfolios are broadly diversified investment portfolios composed of the individual investment options in your plan. Each Model Portfolio is tailored to a specific investment goal and risk profile and will be professionally managed to help you stay on track with your investment strategy.</p>

If you subscribe to the service, your account will be rebalanced to the portfolio option you select. From time to time, funds may be added to or removed from the custom portfolio mixes, or changes may occur to the portfolios' target investment allocations.

            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>It's easy to see why. With target date funds, you have the option of picking one fund with the target date that is closest to the date you want to retire. The funds diversify across a broad mix of domestic and international stocks, and fixed income investments like bonds. The fund gradually adjusts its investment strategy from more aggressive to more conservative as the fund's target date approaches.</p>
                <p>Each fund "targets" a specific year, so you can consider choosing the one closest to when you expect to retire or begin withdrawing assets. Simple as they seem, target date funds aren't foolproof. They're subject to the same risks as the assets they hold. In general, the larger the stake in stocks, the greater the risk. That may not be a big problem if your target is decades away - hopefully you'll have time to recoup losses and take advantage of any market upswings between now and then. But if you expect to retire in just a few years, an ill-timed, across-the-board market crash could put a crimp in your plans.</p>
                <p class="no-vertical-margin"><strong>Know the facts.</strong></p>
                <p>A fund's target date really represents an allocation. That's the mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments the fund aims to hold by its target year, based on its "glide path" or the schedule of assets shifts it makes over time. The date doesn't mean your account will never lose money, or that your account will be fully funded by then. Indeed, growing a viable nest egg depends mostly on three factors: how much you save, how much income you'll need in retirement and how you allocate your investments.</p>

A plan sponsor may exercise certain rights under the group variable annuity contract that may terminate the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits available to participants, including termination of the contract, termination of the plan, or the transfer of the assets left under the contract to another investment fund. Guarantees are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the contract and the prospectus.</p>

Hedge funds are exempt from many of the rules and regulations governing other mutual funds, which allows them to accomplish aggressive investing goals. They are restricted by law to no more than 100 investors per fund, and as a result most hedge funds set extremely high minimum investment amounts, ranging anywhere from $250,000 to over $1 million.

Although the January Effect has been observed numerous times throughout history, it is difficult for investors to profit from it since the market as a whole expects it to happen and therefore adjusts its prices accordingly.</dd>

The NYSE is responsible for setting policy, supervising member activities, listing securities, overseeing the transfer of member seats, and evaluating applicants. It traces its origins back to 1792, when a group of brokers met under a tree at the tip of Manhattan and signed an agreement to trade securities. Unlike some of the newer exchanges , the NYSE still uses a large trading floor in order to conduct its transactions. It is here that the representatives of buyers and sellers, professionals known as brokers, meet and shout out prices at one another in order to strike a deal. This is called the open outcry system and it usually produces fair market pricing. In order to facilitate the exchange of stocks, the NYSE employs individuals called specialists who are assigned to manage the buying and selling of specific stocks and to buy those stocks when no one else will. Of the exchanges, the NYSE has the most stringent set of requirements in place for the companies whose stocks it lists, and even meeting these requirements is not a guarantee that the NYSE will list the company. The NYSE is also called Big Board.</dd>

For stock options, the amount is usually 100 shares. Each option has a buyer, called the holder, and a seller, known as the writer. If the option contract is exercised, the writer is responsible for fulfilling the terms of the contract by delivering the shares to the appropriate party. In the case of a security that cannot be delivered such as an index, the contract is settled in cash. For the holder, the potential loss is limited to the price paid to acquire the option. When an option is not exercised, it expires. No shares change hands and the money spent to purchase the option is lost. For the buyer, the upside is unlimited. Options, like stocks, are therefore said to have an asymmetrical payoff pattern. For the writer, the potential loss is unlimited unless the contract is covered, meaning that the writer already owns the security underlying the option. Options are most frequently as either leverage or protection. As leverage, options allow the holder to control equity in a limited capacity for a fraction of what the shares would cost. The difference can be invested elsewhere until the option is exercised. As protection, options can guard against price fluctuations in the near term because they provide the right acquire the underlying stock at a fixed price for a limited time. risk is limited to the option premium (except when writing options for a security that is not already owned). However, the costs of trading options (including both commissions and the bid/ask spread) is higher on a percentage basis than trading the underlying stock. In addition, options are very complex and require a great deal of observation and maintenance. Aso called option contract.</dd>

The tax benefits associated with savings bonds are significant. Like all treasury securities, they are exempt from state and local taxes, but in the specific case of savings bonds, all federal taxes may be deferred until the bond is redeemed. Therefore, even though interest will accrue, no taxes will be due until that money can be accessed. Additionally, if the money received at redemption is used to pay tuition expenses for the holder, a spouse or a dependent in the same year, the interest earned may be exempt from federal taxes as well. Face values range from $50 to $10,000. Also called U.S. Savings bond.</dd>

                            <dd>Negotiable U.S. Government debt obligations, backed by its full faith and credit. Exempt from state and local taxes. U.S. Treasury Securities are issued by the U.S. government in order to pay for government projects. The money paid out for a Treasury bond is essentially a loan to the government. As with any loan, repayment of principal is accompanied by a specified interest rate. These bonds are guaranteed by the &ldquo;full faith and credit&rdquo; of the U.S. government, meaning that they are extremely low risk (since the government can simply print money to pay back the loan). Additionally, interest earned on U.S. Treasury Securities is exempt from state and local taxes. Federal taxes, however, are still due on the earned interest. The government sells U.S. Treasury Securities by auction in the primary market, but they are marketable securities and therefore can be purchased through a broker in the very active secondary market. A broker will charge a fee for such a transaction, but the government charges no fee to participate in auctions. Prices on the secondary market and at auction are determined by interest rates. U.S. Treasury Securities issued today are not callable, so they will continue to accrue interest until the maturity date. One possible downside to U.S. Treasury Securities is that if interest rates increase during the term of the bond, the money invested will be earning less interest than it could earn elsewhere. Accordingly, the resale value of the bond will decrease as well. Because there is almost no risk of default by the government, the return on Treasury bonds is relatively low, and a high inflation rate can erase most of the gains by reducing the value of the principal and interest payments. There are three types of securities issued by the U.S. Treasury (bonds, bills,and notes), which are distinguished by the amount of time from the initial sale of the bond to maturity. Also called Treasuries.</dd>

Value funds tend to focus on safety rather than growth, and often choose investments providing dividends as well as capital appreciation. They invest in companies that have low P/E ratio, and stocks that have fallen out of favor with mainstream investors, either due to changing investor preferences, a poor quarterly earnings report, or hard times in a particular industry. Value stocks are often mature companies that have stopped growing and that use their earnigs to pay dividends.

                            <dd>A defined contribution plan, established by an employer. It enables employees to make pretax contributions by salary reduction agreements structured within the format of a cash or deferred plan.</dd>

                            <dt><dfn>457 Plan</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>A tax-exempt deferred compensation program made available to employees of state and federal governments and agencies. A 457 plan is similar to a 401(k) plan, except there are never employer matching contributions and the IRS does not consider it a qualified retirement plan. Participants can defer some of their annual income (up to an annual limit), and contributions and earnings are tax-deferred until withdrawal. Distributions start at retirement age but participants can also take distributions if they change jobs or in certain emergencies. Participants can choose to take distributions as a lump sum, annual installments or as an annuity. Distributions are subject to ordinary income taxes and the amounts cannot be transferred into an IRA.</dd>
